# Getting Started

## Connecting

First of all to perform an investment using Deunifi, you must connect using Metamask.

At the time of writing we are supporting only Metamask, but we are working to integrate more wallets to our App.
{% endhint %}

## Proxy Creation

To perform any transaction in Deunifi, it is used the MakerDAO proxy associated with the connected account.

If you already own a proxy in MakerDAO you can skip this section

{% hint style="info" %}
If you own a proxy in MakerDAO, then Deunifi App it is going to automatically recognize your proxy, and the 'CREATE PROXY' button will disappear.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The proxy creation it is done only once. Once created it is used that proxy for all the transactions done with Deunifi. 
{% endhint %}

The proxy creation it is very simple. You only need to click the 'CREATE PROXY' button:

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that to perform any transaction in the Ethereum network you are going to need ETH.
{% endhint %}

When transaction is in progress a message is displayed with a button to access to its details and status in Etherscan.

After the transaction is confirmed, a message confirm this, and you can access to it in Etherscan too. Additionally, after a few seconds the 'CREATE PROXY' button will disappear and the 'CREATE VAULT' button will be available:
