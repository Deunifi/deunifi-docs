# Introduction

Deunifi is a project in the Ethereum network that integrates the protocols MakerDAO, UniswapV2 and AAVE with the objective of simplify investments that, to be achieved, require multiple transactions and that have high costs.

The idea here is to achieve the same results, performing only one transaction with lower costs.
