# Introduction

Deunifi is a project in the Ethereum network that integrates the protocols MakerDAO, UniswapV2 and AAVE, with the objective of simplify investment operations that, to be achieved, require multiple transactions and that have high costs.

The idea here is to get the same results, only with one transaction, and with lower costs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Deunifi does not offer its own assets, instead, any investment done with Deunifi works with UniswapV2 liquidity pool tokens that are locked in your own MakerDAO vaults to create a collateralized position.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Additionally, as a security measure, Deunifi was designed to not be able to perform operations with your vaults and your tokens. This way, your investments are yours and only yours.
{% endhint %}
