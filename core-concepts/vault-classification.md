# Vault Classification

We can classify the different vault types in 3 groups depending on the tokens associated with them and the tokens volatility:

* The group of high volatility vaults composed with two high volatile tokens \(for example UNIV2WBTCETH-A that it is composed with WBTC and ETH\).
* The group of middle volatility vaults composed with one volatile token and one stable coin token \(for example UNIV2DAIETH-A that it is composed with DAI and ETH\).
* The group of stable vaults composed with two stable coin tokens \(for example UNIV2DAIUSDC-A that it is composed with DAI and USDC\)

## High Volatility Vaults

The main characteristics of this kind of vaults are:

* In case of tokens price increasing, the value is conserved.
